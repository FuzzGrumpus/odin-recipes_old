        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Gin & Tonic. If you can say it, you can make it. Right? Right. But also, not exactly. The two-ingredient cocktail requires your undivided attention. From glassware to garnish to style of gin and spirit proof, everything should be carefully considered when mixing a G&T. 
            </p>
            <p>A Gin & Tonic made with a potent base—45% ABV and above, if you mean business—and configured with two parts tonic to one part gin is a highball of balance and beauty. Too much gin, and the botanical spirit will overshadow the unique qualities of the tonic. Too much tonic, and it will drown the gin. 
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

                </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
